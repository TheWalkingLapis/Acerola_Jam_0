Game Concept: That Level Again - Style Puzzle Game
Story: You are inside of a space-station on the moon. You are alone in your personal station. You suddenly lost all contact.
		One Final Message reaches you, letting you know that the 'experiment' failed and you need to get out of there.
		In the attempt to create an infinite energy source by controlling and reversing Entropy, scientists created pure chaos.
		This matter affects time and space and causes anomalies (Aberrations) whereever it goes. Beacuse of the dangers, a team of astronauts and scientist
		researched on the moon. You are the last remaining member of this team. In order to survive, you need to escape using your escape pod.
		
Game: The Goal of every Level is to access and use the escape pod in a certain time. When the time runs out, the player dies and everything is consumed by
		pure chaos. Dying results in restarting the level, as chronical anomalies safe your life. 'Escpaing' is also met with an anomaly reseting you back
		to the station, but into a different level, which only differs slightly in appearance, but has a totally different way to escape.
		After x Levels, you gain access to your laboratory, which lets you aquire some sort of time-stabilizer. Escaping with this device will allow you to
		finally leave the moon and return home!
