# PROJECT Aleph

This game is being created as my contribution to the Acerola Jam 0: 
  https://thewalkinglapis.itch.io/project-aleph
  
It is a short puzzle game where you are a scientist that needs to escape from the moon after a failed experiment.

This project has been done using Godot 4.
All assets were created by me during the jam.
Tools used:
3D Models - Blender
Textures - Gimp 2.0
Sound - Audacity
Music - BeepBox (beepbox.co)
