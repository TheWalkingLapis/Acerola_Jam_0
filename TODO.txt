		One Final Message reaches you, letting you know that the 'experiment' failed and you need to get out of there.
		In the attempt to create an infinite energy source by controlling and reversing Entropy, scientists created somehting referred to as 'pure chaos'.
		This ...matter affects time and space and causes anomalies (Aberrations) whereever it goes. Beacuse of the dangers, you and your colleagues
		researched on the moon, far away from the rest of humanity. You are the last remaining member of this team. In order to survive, 
		you need to escape using your escape pod before the chaos consumes you.
		
Game: The Goal of every Level is to access and use the escape pod. 'Escpaing' is met with an anomaly reseting you back
		to the station, but into a different level, which only differs slightly in appearance, but has a totally different way to escape.
		After x Levels, you gain access to some sort of time-stabilizer. Escaping with this device will allow you to
		finally leave the moon and return home!
