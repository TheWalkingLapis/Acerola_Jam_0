Experiments have been deemed too dangerous to be performed nearby populated areas. The first breakthroughs of PROJECT Aleph were performed in remote areas, until one accident of catasrophical extend took place. Though lots of people fell victim to this tragedy, the black-box recordings could not have been ignored. Continuing PROJECT Aleph on planet Earth was no longer an option.
