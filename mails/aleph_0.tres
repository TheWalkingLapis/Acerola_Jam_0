content = "In dire need of a new energy source, humanity set out on a quest for new energy supplies. Few Organizations were able to secure funding for their projects though, as the concept of an (nearly) 'infinite energy source' still sounded highly suspicious back then. The founders of Aleph_ZERO, now known as PROJECT Aleph, were still able to convince these people. The experiments they proposed posed a considerable thread in the case of failure though. This is why the Aleph Space Program was created, with the first big goal of building a research facility on the moon.
